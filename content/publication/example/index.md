abstract: "Cameras are widely used in many scenes such as robot positioning and
  unmanned driving, in which the camera calibration is a major task in this
  field. The interactive camera calibration method based on a plane board is
  becoming popular due to its stability and handleability. However, most methods
  choose suggestions subjectively from a fixed pose dataset, which is
  error-prone and limited for different camera models. In addition, these
  methods do not provide clear guidelines on how to place the board in the
  specified pose. This paper proposes a new interactive calibration method,
  named ‘Calibration Venus’, including two main parts: pose search and pose
  decomposition. First, a pose search algorithm based on simulated annealing
  (SA) algorithm is proposed to select the optimal pose in the entire pose
  space. Second, an intuitive and easy-to-use user guidance method is designed
  to decompose the optimal pose into four sub-poses: translation, each rotation
  along X-, Y-, Z-axes. Thereby the users could follow the guide step by step to
  accurately complete the placement of the calibration board. Experimental
  results evaluated on simulated and real datasets show that the proposed method
  can reduce the difficulty of calibration, and improve the accuracy of
  calibration, as well as provide better guidance."
